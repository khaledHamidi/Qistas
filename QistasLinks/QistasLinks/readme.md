# QistasLinks

QistasLinks is a C# .NET 7 DLL library developed make serial interface(RS232) communication easy and efficient for any project utilizing a serial connection. With its user-friendly methods and robust features, QistasLinks simplifies the process of establishing communication with microcontrollers and facilitates seamless data exchange, By integrating QistasLinks into your application, you can benefit from enhanced performance and extended capabilities, making it the ideal choice for any project relying on serial connections.

## Features

- Serial Communication: QistasLinks enables easy and efficient read/write operations for serial or RS232 interfaces. It provides a reliable and flexible communication channel between microcontrollers and computers.

- Data Transfer Pattern: The library offers a data transfer pattern that simplifies the process of exchanging data between microcontrollers and computers. It provides a structured approach for sending and receiving data packets.

The QistasLinks DLL library offers support for a custom command or instruction format, allowing users to communicate with the serial devices in a structured manner. This format enables precise control and configuration of the connected devices based on specific commands issued.
### -Customizable Data Transfer Pattern Support 

The QistasLinks library offers the flexibility for users to define their own data patterns. Instead of being restricted to a specific pattern, such as `<data...>`,`{data...}\n` or `data1 data2 ...` , users have the freedom to create their own custom patterns based on their project specific requirements.


###Custom Command/Instruction Format

The QistasLinks DLL library provides a custom command or instruction format that simplifies communication with serial devices in a structured way. This format allows you to precisely control and configure connected devices by issuing specific commands.

Let's get an example:
In this format, each command follows a consistent structure: "<operation> <key>:<value>". Let's break it down:

To illustrate how QistasLinks works, first you have to make the pattren for that structure : "#opration# #key#:#value#". This format can be used as a pattern. and when data recived, its will  build a dynamic object where the command elements correspond to object properties."obj.operation," "obj.key," and "obj.value" that hold the respective values of the command.

By utilizing this custom command format, you can easily construct and parse commands for interacting with serial devices using the QistasLinks DLL library. It provides a flexible and intuitive way to control device behavior and configuration.

For more detailed instructions and specific command examples, please refer to the documentation and examples provided with the library.
